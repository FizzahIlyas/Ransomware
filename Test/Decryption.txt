Decryption is the transformation of data that has been encrypted and rendered 
unreadable back to its unencrypted form. The garbled data is extracted by the system 
and converted and transformed into texts and images that are easily understandable 
by the reader as well as the system. Simply put, decryption is essentially the 
reverse of encryption, which requires coding data to make it unreadable, but the 
matching decryption keys can make it readable.
