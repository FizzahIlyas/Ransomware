Encryption is a process that scrambles readable text so it can only be read by the 
person who has the secret code,  or decryption key. It helps provide data security 
for sensitive information. Vast amounts of personal information are managed online 
and stored in the cloud or on servers with an ongoing connection to the web. It’s 
nearly impossible to do business of any kind without your personal data ending up 
in an organization’s networked computer system, which is why it’s important to know 
how to help keep that data  private.
